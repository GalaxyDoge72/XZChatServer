The server software for [XZChat](https://github.com/GalaxyDoge72/XZChat), a TCP chatting client.

Requires OpenSSL.

Keep in mind that you will need to port-forward if you want to have a public facing server.
Do keep in mind there is no encryption for this software. This is because I am lazy to implement AES.
